#### What Was My Role?

⬤ I served as the UX Project Lead, and in this role, I was involved in all phases of design using the Design Thinking methodology.

⬤ I led the development squad following the Agile SCRUM methodology, working with a multicultural and multidisciplinary team. I participated in the ceremonies, attended client meetings, and joined mentoring sessions.

⬤ I faced the challenge of iterating the designs based on user feedback and the needs outlined by EdVisto.

⬤ I approached the development of an intuitive and visually appealing interface that promotes project-based learning. This involved understanding the client’s goals and user needs, conducting research, creating mockups and prototypes, testing, and making the necessary iterations.

#### The Problem

How can we develop a user interface that allows children aged 8 to 12 to create and share their own videos, integrating them with the existing teacher evaluation module?

How can we promote essential 21st-century skills, especially the 4 Cs of education (Communication, Critical Thinking, Creativity, and Collaboration), alongside a focus on phenomenon-based learning?

What solution can we offer that is not only accessible and easy to use for children, but also facilitates teacher evaluation and promotes the comprehensive development of these fundamental skills for the future?

#### The Requirements

Develop an interface aimed at child users, designed to function as an interactive field journal.

This environment must ensure safety in information searching and allow users to express their learning through video creation.

Integrate the Socratic method, storytelling, and artificial intelligence.

#### The Design Process

In the design process, the double diamond model was adopted, alternating between phases of convergence and divergence to explore and refine ideas.

To conceptualize the interface, the Socratic method and Julian Greimas’ actantial model were combined, along with the integration of artificial intelligence elements.

This combination allowed for the development of an interface that facilitates the user's creation of their Videostorytelling in an intuitive and effective way.

We also chose a design that prioritizes accessibility for users with different needs. The large font size (16px for body text and up to 32px for headers) improves readability, especially for users with dyslexia. The Urbanist and Inter sans-serif fonts were selected for their clarity and ease of reading.

The high color contrast ensures that text is easily visible, while the line spacing helps users follow the text without difficulty. The buttons in orange and violet are attention-grabbing but not overwhelming; the orange emphasizes action, and the violet provides contrast without being distracting, making it easier for users with ADHD to stay focused. Furthermore, the consistent text styles ensure that users with autism can better understand and predict the content structure.

This combination allowed for the development of an interface that facilitates the user's creation of their Videostorytelling in an intuitive and effective way.

#### The Solution

<strong class="font-bold text-lg"> After conducting surveys to understand user needs: </strong>
<br>
⬤ Low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes were developed.

⬤ Testing was carried out to ensure the usability and effectiveness of the prototypes.

<br>
<br>
<strong class="font-bold text-lg">The development was divided into four specialized teams: </strong>
<br>
⬤ One team was responsible for designing the login process.

⬤ Another team focused on designing the content feed.

⬤ A third team dedicated itself to developing the search module.

⬤ The final team, of which I was a part, concentrated on creating and analyzing content within the interactive field journal.

This division strategy allowed for the optimization of the development process and ensured meticulous attention to every aspect of the proposed solution.
