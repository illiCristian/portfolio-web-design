#### Context and challenge

When Alfa 2006 approached me, they had a clear mission: they needed a visual identity that reflected their vast experience in the agricultural and mining sectors, while also projecting trust to investors and buyers. I knew the challenge was big, but I also saw an incredible opportunity to transform their image and take it to the next level.

#### Project Objectives

With this challenge in mind, I set the following key goals:

- Create a cohesive visual identity that could encompass both the agricultural and mining sectors.
- Develop a professional digital presence that would inspire trust among their investors and clients.

#### Process

The first step in any large design project is listening. I took the time to understand not only what Alfa 2006 did but why they did it. Listening to their goals allowed me to begin visualizing how we could graphically represent their mission.

#### Research

I started by conducting an analysis of the agricultural and mining markets in Argentina, exploring how other brands positioned themselves visually and what expectations investors and clients had in these sectors. I realized the challenge was in finding a balance: conveying Alfa 2006's traditional essence without losing the contemporary and trustworthy focus they were seeking.

#### Visual Identity Development

With this research in hand, the next step was to translate these ideas into design. I knew we needed a color palette that connected with the earth and nature, representing their agricultural side, but also more sober tones to communicate the solidity of their mining branch. Typography also played a fundamental role: I chose a modern and professional typeface that was clear and readable, but also had a touch of elegance to reflect their maturity in the market.

#### Brand Design and Positioning

With each iteration, the design took shape. I developed a series of visual resources, from the logo to the materials for the website. Every detail was aligned with Alfa 2006's mission: to reflect professionalism, but also humanity and connection to the land.

#### The Solution

The final design achieved what we set out to do from the beginning. Alfa 2006 now has a visual identity that not only clearly communicates their agricultural and mining products but also projects an image of trust and professionalism. Every visual element was designed to resonate with their two key audiences: investors and buyers. The new logo and website redesign helped position Alfa 2006 as a reliable player in both sectors.
