This design was conceived as part of my participation in the **InTech MOM**program, which took place from June to December 2023.

_InTech MOM_ is a program that combines theory and practice, and in which participants:

- Collaborate on real-world projects for clients
- Create solutions from scratch
- Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in 8 sprints (16 weeks)
- Work in multidisciplinary teams
- Learn and apply Agile methodologies
- Develop soft skills

EdVisto: A Finnish Educational Platform
EdVisto is an educational platform of Finnish origin, designed for children aged 8 to 12 that promotes "video storytelling" as a learning method.

My Role
I served as the UX Project Lead, involved in all phases of the design process using the Design Thinking methodology.
I led the development squad under the Agile SCRUM methodology, working with a multicultural and multidisciplinary team. I fulfilled all ceremonies, attended meetings with the client, and participated in mentorship sessions.
I faced the challenge of iterating designs based on user feedback and the needs outlined by EdVisto.
I tackled the development of an intuitive and engaging interface that fosters project-based learning. This involved understanding the client's objectives and user needs, conducting research, creating mockups and prototypes, testing, and making the necessary iterations.

The Problem
How to develop a user interface that would allow children aged 8 to 12 to create and share their own videos, integrating them with the existing teacher evaluation module?
How to promote essential 21st-century skills, especially the 4 Cs of education (Communication, Critical Thinking, Creativity, and Collaboration), along with a focus on phenomenon-based learning?
What solution could we offer that was not only accessible and easy to use for children but also facilitated teacher evaluation and promoted the comprehensive development of these fundamental skills for the future?

Requirements
Develop an interface designed for child users, to function as an interactive field journal.
This environment must ensure the safety of information searches and allow users to capture their learning through video creation.
Integrate the Socratic method, storytelling, and artificial intelligence.

The Solution
After conducting a survey to understand user needs:

Low and high-fidelity prototypes were developed.
Testing was conducted to ensure the usability and effectiveness of the prototypes.
Development was divided into four specialized teams:

One team was responsible for designing the login process.
Another team focused on designing the content feed.
A third team dedicated itself to developing the search module.
The last team, which I was part of, focused on the creation and analysis of content within the interactive field journal. This division strategy optimized the development process and ensured meticulous attention to each aspect of the proposed solution.
Would you like me to translate or format any other text?

Note: I've used Markdown headings (###, ##) to structure the text and make it more readable. You can customize the formatting further using Markdown syntax. For example, to create a bulleted list, use asterisks (\*).

Here's an example of a bulleted list using Markdown:

Low and high-fidelity prototypes were developed.
Testing was conducted to ensure the usability and effectiveness of the prototypes.
Let me know if you have any other requests.
