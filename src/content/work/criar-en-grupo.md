##### About the app

Parenting is a space that revitalizes living in a group, supported and accompanied by others. Sharing the experience of parenting with a group that forms a support network helps to address the loneliness imposed by modern life. This is how "Criar en Grupo" was born, an app that allows you to find your online community. Here, you can share experiences, questions, and everything related to motherhood and parenting.

Because thereâ€™s nothing more powerful than feeling supported through the journey of raising a child.

##### The Problem

Online groups and communities have emerged to fulfill the existing need for a parenting tribe. However, the services currently available are solely focused on moms and pregnancy tracking, without considering the diversity of family types.

##### The Design Process

In the design process, the Design Thinking methodology was utilized, guiding us through empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing.

We began with benchmarking and user interviews to validate user needs and insights. From there, we developed an MVP, which served as the foundation for refining our solutions.

User flows and information architecture were carefully diagrammed, followed by the creation of wireframes and an interactive prototype. This approach enabled us to iterate quickly and effectively, ensuring that the final product meets the users' needs in an intuitive and engaging way.

##### The Solution

After conducting surveys to understand user needs:

- Low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes were developed.
- Testing was carried out to ensure the usability and effectiveness of the prototypes.

The development was divided into four specialized teams:

- One team was responsible for designing the login process.
- Another team focused on designing the content feed.
- A third team dedicated itself to developing the search module.
- The final team, of which I was a part, concentrated on creating and analyzing content within the interactive field journal.

This division strategy allowed for the optimization of the development process and ensured meticulous attention to every aspect of the proposed solution.
